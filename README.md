# alligatorjobs

Alligator Jobs is a full-stack App designed to help refugees find work in America. Our application 
creates an easy to use platform and database for job seekers, their caseworkers and potential employers to connect easily in ways that erase the divide between different working cultures.

Job seekers can create profiles that showcase skills rather than simply employment history, employers can create job postings and case workers have an easy to use dashboard to connect the two and track clientele status.
